## 1. Isha's Event Planner (Bad App Design)

**Description:** A deliberately flawed application designed to showcase poor interaction design practices for an Interaction Design course project. The app breaks various usability heuristics and design principles.

**Features:**
- Overly large menu buttons cluttering the interface.
- Misplaced buttons leading to confusing navigation.
- Unintuitive error messages and rating system.

**The Bad App:** https://www.figma.com/design/kK71P37h2IEdMNk5Uzbdeq/Isha-shah-(Milestone-2---The-Bad-App)?m=auto&t=ai88yIpvKBuFG3SR-6

## 2. The Player Card

**Description:** This personalized player card presents an overview of my personality and interests. The front side highlights my role in web development, creativity as a superpower, and my journey with Figma, while the back shares my joy for dancing, love for K-dramas, and a fun "Two Truths and a Lie" game, complete with memes that reflect my calm and artistic side.
